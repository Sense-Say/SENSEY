Depth Anything V2 installation for RPI5 used

1.) Go to https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-trained-models
or search Depth Anything V2 Github on google

2.) Download Pre Trained Models, any of that..

3.) in the Rpi Terminal, copy and paste this to install...

git clone https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2
cd Depth-Anything-V2
pip install -r requirements.txt

4.) Depth-Anything-V2 Folder will appear in your File Manager,
 Move your depth_anything_v2_vits.pth file inside the new Depth-Anything-V2 folder that was just created.

5.) Also in this github file, download the convert.py and live_depth.py then
put it as well in the Depth-Anything-V2 Folder

6.) In Thonny..
Go to Tools > Manage packages...
Search for onnxscript and click Install.
Search for onnx (just the word "onnx") and click Install (if not already installed).
also...
Install onnxruntime (if not installed yet).
Install opencv-python (if not installed yet).

7.) Then now in thonny, run first the convert.py to change the depth_anything_v2_vits.pth
into depth_anything_v2_vits.onnx good for Rpi5 system.

8.) lastly run the live_depth.py to show the video feed...


####NOTE#####
In my case using only Rpi5 with 8gb RAM is still lagging with 2-3fps so I think
by using a Rpi AI HAT+ 26 TOPS will make this run more smoother and faster.
