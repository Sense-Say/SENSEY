1.) The First thing I do is to install a DEBIAN BOOKWORM LEGACY FULL version because if i use DEBIAN TRIXIE, which is right now in this date DEC2025, still new and still prone to error.
Also another reason is that since I will be using HAILO8 AI HAT for RPI5, i would be need to specifically use this github repository https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples which only support DEBIAN BOOKWORM.
On the otherhand this repository https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps-infra/tree/main, support DEBIAN TRIXIE.




2.) After Installation of OS in sd card, proceed on following this guide. https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/raspberry-pi/yolo-pose-estimation-on-the-raspberry-pi-hat-writing-custom-python-code/#X2V2KAI

# Now whenever you exit the terminal, you should always do this
cd hailo-rpi5-examples
source setup_env.sh




3.) Next thing I do is to try using Thonny instead of running in terminal only.
Here I first run the pose_estimation.py, which I send here but also you can find in this location /home/raspberrypi/hailo-rpi5-examples/basic_pipelines.

# As a note, you neet to set the interpreter in thonny by doing this.
Open Thonny > Run > Configure Interpreter > then one by one follow this folder until you click the last file which is "python3" (/home/raspberrypi/hailo-rpi5-examples/venv_hailo_rpi_examples/bin/python3).





4.) Now through coding I have accomplish the action logic 1st progress.py and pose estimation 1st progress.py. I will not explain the construction of this code, let AI do that hhaha.
In short, I want to recognize the pose of Standing, Walking, and Raising Hand.

if you want to play your own video or your usb camera, just revise this specific code.....
   # 1. Set Camera Input
        print("Setting input to /dev/video0")
        sys.argv.extend(["--input", "/dev/video0"])


Beside the --input which is the "/dev/video0", this is the one you will replace.

# If you want to use your own video, first go the the video you have in your file manager> COPY PATH > then replace this dev/video0 and CTRL+V inside the " ".
# IF you want to play again the usb camera, just put again dev/video0 or specifically  usb.






5.) Now in the final code I have done, what change is that.
    a) I have use a Yolov8m_pose model using this...
    HEF_PATH = "/home/raspberrypi/hailo-rpi5-examples/resources/models/hailo8/yolov8m_pose.hef"
       # to find this yolov8m_pose.hef, just follow this and open the folder one by one (/home/raspberrypi/hailo-rpi5-examples/resources/models/hailo8/yolov8m_pose.hef) then COPY PATH, with that you are using YOLOv8 pose model.
   
    b) add this sys.argv.extend(["--disable-sync"]) and this sys.argv.extend(["--frame-rate", str(DESIRED_FPS)]), to make the processing of video or live feed faster and managable.

Hailo App Help

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input INPUT, -i INPUT
                        Input source. Can be a file, USB (webcam), RPi camera
                        (CSI camera module) or ximage. For RPi camera use '-i
                        rpi' For automatically detect a connected usb camera,
                        use '-i usb' For manually specifying a connected usb
                        camera, use '-i /dev/video<X>' Defaults to application
                        specific video.
  --use-frame, -u       Use frame from the callback function
  --show-fps, -f        Print FPS on sink
  --arch {hailo8,hailo8l,hailo10h}
                        Specify the Hailo architecture (hailo8 or hailo8l or
                        hailo10h). Default is None , app will run check.
  --hef-path HEF_PATH   Path to HEF file
  --disable-sync        Disables display sink sync, will run as fast as
                        possible. Relevant when using file source.
  --disable-callback    Disables the user's custom callback function in the
                        pipeline. Use this option to run the pipeline without
                        invoking the callback logic.
  --dump-dot            Dump the pipeline graph to a dot file pipeline.dot
  --frame-rate FRAME_RATE, -r FRAME_RATE
                        Frame rate of the video source. Default is 30.
