# CREATING FOLDER HERE IN GITHUB

If you want to create an empty folder here on GitHub.com you need to create an EMPTY FILE inside of it since it doesn't support creation of empty folders.

Here's how:

1) Go to your repo,
2) Click on "Create new file",
3) In the "Name your file" input box type the folder name + "/" (slash symbol) + the new filename (anything works, like dummy, keep, etc.), e.g.

EXPECTED OUTPUT Name file: new-folder/dummy
