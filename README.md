# SENSEY: An Intelligent Wearable Aid with Real-Time Object Detection and Multimodal Feedback for Inclusive Education

Welcome to the repository for **SENSEY**! This project is dedicated to developing an intelligent wearable aid designed to empower visually impaired teachers in inclusive education settings. SENSEY leverages cutting-edge AI-driven computer vision, specifically YOLOv8, combined with multimodal haptic and audio feedback to enhance classroom mobility, object identification, student interaction, and overall spatial awareness.

Our goal is to create a robust and efficient system that bridges the existing gaps in assistive technology, providing real-time, adaptive support for educators.

## ✨ Features & Project Components

This repository is structured to provide clear access to the various modules and functionalities that comprise the SENSEY wearable aid and its underlying AI infrastructure.

*   **Blind Navigation:**
    *   This core module implements the navigation logic and processes sensory data to provide guidance for visually impaired users. It integrates outputs from perception models to offer intuitive feedback.

*   **Depth Estimation Model:**
    *   Dedicated to 3D scene understanding, this component includes models and code for estimating the depth of objects using a stereo camera. It's crucial for simulating "Human Binocular Vision" and understanding obstacle distances in the environment.

*   **Face Recognition Folder:**
    *   Focuses on the facial identification capabilities essential for SENSEY. This includes code and notes for recognizing students within the classroom environment, supporting enhanced teacher-student interaction.

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Contains detailed documentation, design files (e.g., 3D CAD for mounting cases), and setup instructions for the physical components of the SENSEY wearable device, including the Raspberry Pi 5 enclosure, stereo camera mount, and battery holder.

*   **Ollama AI for summarizing the terminal prompt:**
    *   *(Note: This component appears to be a general AI development tool for enhancing developer workflow, rather than a direct feature of the SENSEY wearable aid. It's included here as part of the broader repository's AI solutions.)* Explores integrating Ollama AI for terminal output summarization.

*   **Pose Estimation Model:**
    *   Documents the development and initial progress of the pose estimation module. This is vital for detecting and tracking student behaviors and actions in real-time within the classroom.

*   **Text to Speech Folder:**
    *   Implements the text-to-speech functionalities that drive SENSEY's audio feedback system, allowing the device to provide clear, audible information to the user.

*   **WaveShare UPS Module 3S:**
    *   Manages the integration and functionality of the WaveShare UPS Module 3S, ensuring reliable power supply and extended operational time for the portable SENSEY device.

*   **README.md:**
    *   (You are currently reading this file!) Provides a comprehensive overview of the SENSEY project, its features, and guidance for development and contribution.

*   **Raspberry Pi5 AI HAT + Hailo installation notes:**
    *   Contains essential notes and guides for setting up the Raspberry Pi 5 with an AI HAT, specifically optimized for Hailo AI accelerators to ensure efficient on-device inference for SENSEY's various AI models.
