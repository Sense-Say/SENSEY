By going directly to the hailo-apps-infra repository, you bypassed the strict version checks and configuration issues inside the hailo-rpi5-examples wrapper.
Since you confirmed that install.sh completed and videos are running, you now have a fully working AI powerhouse (26 TOPS) on your Raspberry Pi 5.
Why this worked

As the community post you shared earlier mentioned, Hailo is transitioning hailo-apps-infra to be the main software repository.


The Old Way: hailo-rpi5-examples (This was failing because it was trying to force specific, older versions).
The New Way: hailo-apps-infra (This is the "engine" itself, and it was able to adapt to your installed 4.23 drivers).


⚠️ Important Next Steps to Keep it Working
Now that it works, do not touch the drivers.
Lock your setup:
Run this command one last time to make sure a random system update doesn't break your hard-earned success:
sudo apt-mark hold hailo-all hailort hailort-pcie-driver


How to run apps from now on:
Since you installed the infrastructure directly, your workflow is slightly different. Always remember to activate the environment inside that folder before running scripts:
cd hailo-apps-infra
source setup_env.sh


Cool things to try (for your 26 TOPS board):
Since you have the powerful Hailo-8 (not the weaker 8L), you can run the heavier applications mentioned in the release notes you found:

Tiling (High Res Detection):
python hailo_apps/tiling/tiling.py --input resources/video/example.mp4

Multi-stream (Running multiple videos at once):
python hailo_apps/multisource/multisource.py


Congratulations on getting it running! The mismatch between Bookworm, Trixie, and the Hailo drivers is a difficult hurdle, and you cleared it. Enjoy your AI HAT!
