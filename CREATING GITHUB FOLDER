If you want to create an empty folder here on GitHub.com you need to create an EMPTY FILE inside of it since it doesn't support creation of empty folders.

Here's how:

1) Go to your repo,
2) Click on "Create new file",
3) In the "Name your file" input box type the folder name + "/" (slash symbol) + the new filename (anything works, like dummy, keep, etc.), e.g.

EXPECTED OUTPUT Name file: new-folder/dummy
