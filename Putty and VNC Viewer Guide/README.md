### Phase 1: Prepare the Raspberry Pi (Server)

Before leaving the Pi, you must enable the "doors" that PuTTY and VNC use to enter.

1.  Open a terminal on your Pi and type:
    ```bash
    sudo raspi-config
    ```
2.  Navigate to **Interface Options**.
3.  **Enable SSH** (for PuTTY).
4.  **Enable VNC** (for the visual desktop).
      * **Note: Raspberry Pi 5 uses Wayland by default. Most VNC viewers work, but if you have trouble, the built-in "Screen Sharing" in Raspberry Pi OS settings is the preferred method.**
5.  **Get your IP Address**:
    ```bash
    hostname -I
    ```
    *(Example: 192.168.1.15)*

### Phase 2: Install Software on your Laptop (Client)

#### 1. For PuTTY (Command Line)
*   **Download**: [PuTTY Official Site](https://www.putty.org/)
*   **Installation**: Standard Windows `.msi` installer.

#### 2. For VNC (Visual Desktop)
*   **Download**: [RealVNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)
*   **Installation**: Standard installer.

### Phase 3: The "Dual-Connection" Workflow

To work efficiently, you will open **both** at the same time.

#### Step 1: Connect via PuTTY
1.  Open PuTTY.
2.  In **Host Name**, type your Pi's IP address.
3.  Click **Open**.
4.  Login (usually username `raspberrypi` and your password).
5.  **Why?** PuTTY is much faster than the VNC terminal for typing, copying/pasting code, and seeing error logs.

#### Step 2: Connect via VNC Viewer
1.  Open RealVNC Viewer.
2.  Type the Pi's IP address in the top bar and hit Enter.
3.  Log in with your Pi credentials.
4.  **Why?** You will use this window **only** to see the video output generated by your AI script.

### Phase 4: Running your Hailo Code via PuTTY

This is the part that usually confuses users. If you run a script in PuTTY, the Pi doesn't know which screen to show the video on. You must "direct" the traffic.

#### 1. The Setup Commands
In your PuTTY window, prepare your environment:
```bash
cd /home/raspberrypi/hailo-rpi5-examples
source setup_env.sh
```

#### 2. The Execution Command
To make the video appear on the VNC screen while the text stays in PuTTY, run your script like this:

```bash
DISPLAY=:0 PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 "/home/raspberrypi/SENSEY/Text to Speech Folder/Dorongon/1st progres/detection.py"
```

**Breakdown of that command:**
*   `DISPLAY=:0`: This tells the script: "Don't try to show video in the PuTTY window; show it on the main HDMI/VNC desktop."
*   `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`: This tells Python: "Send every `print()` message to PuTTY immediately, don't wait."

### Phase 5: Troubleshooting common "Remote" issues

#### Issue 1: "Could not open display"
*   **Cause**: You are running the script in PuTTY but didn't tell it to use the VNC screen.
*   **Fix**: Always put `DISPLAY=:0` before your python command.

#### Issue 2: PuTTY terminal is "frozen" or not showing prints
*   **Cause**: Python is buffering text.
*   **Fix**: Ensure your Python code uses `print("message", flush=True)` or run with `python3 -u`.

#### Issue 3: VNC is laggy
*   **Cause**: VNC sends the whole desktop over Wi-Fi.
*   **Fix**: Reduce the Raspberry Pi resolution in `raspi-config` or use an Ethernet cable for both the Pi and Laptop.

### Summary Checklist for Daily Use
1.  **Laptop**: Open **PuTTY** -> Login.
2.  **Laptop**: Open **VNC** -> Keep it in the background.
3.  **PuTTY**: `source setup_env.sh`.
4.  **PuTTY**: `DISPLAY=:0 python3 -u your_script.py`.
5.  **Result**: Watch the text logs in **PuTTY** and the AI video in **VNC**.
